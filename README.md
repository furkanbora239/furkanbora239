# Hi there, I'm Furkan Bora! 👋

### Technical Solutions Specialist | Automation & Integration Engineer

I don't just write code; I build **resilient systems** that eliminate manual work and solve expensive operational bottlenecks. My background combines the discipline of corporate technical support with the agility of startup engineering.

🚀 **My Philosophy:** I am **tool-agnostic**. Whether a solution requires Python for backend automation, Dart for cross-platform apps, or reverse-engineering an internal API, I adapt and use the right tool to get the job done efficiently.

## 🛠️ Engineering Showcase (Technical Deep Dives)

Due to the proprietary nature of my core work (High-frequency bots, Scrapers, Anti-detection systems), the source codes are private. However, I have published detailed **architectural breakdowns** of these systems below:

| Project | Tech Stack | Highlights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[High-Frequency Transaction Architecture](https://github.com/furkanbora239/high-frequency-transaction-engine)** | `Python` `Nodriver` `curl_cffi` | Hybrid automation engine with **<50ms latency**, featuring TLS fingerprint spoofing and custom token generation. |
| **[Distributed Browser Cluster](https://github.com/furkanbora239/distributed-browser-cluster)** | `Node.js` `Puppeteer` `Stealth` | Running **40+ concurrent browser sessions** on a single consumer laptop (16GB RAM) with aggressive resource throttling. |
| **[MacOS Hardware Input Bridge](https://github.com/furkanbora239/macos-hardware-input-bridge)** | `Flutter` `Swift` `Dart FFI` | A bridge between Dart and native macOS IOKit drivers to read low-latency USB Joystick data for scientific research. |
